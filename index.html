                <h2>What is Pelagius?</h2>
                <p>
                    Pelagius is an open source Discord bot written in Discord.js that was designed for a very niche but useful scenario.
                    It is designed for use as a utility when modding Bethesda games such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4.
                    Many modding guides exist that users can follow to achieve a stable modded game. Pelagius acts as a source of
                    validation for your users to help them check if they have completed your guide correctly, and troubleshoot
                    potential problems.
                </p>

                <h2>What do we want from you?</h2>
                <p>
                    Well, that depends on who you are. If you're an author of a modding guide, we'd like for you to adopt our
                    project and use it in your Discord community. Our team is ready to help you out and troubleshoot any
                    problems you may encounter when using or setting up Pelagius. We're also always open to ideas for
                    future features to be added (such as support for custom files, which is currently in progress). We ask
                    developers to test our project themselves, fork it, make their own changes, etc. Feel free to submit
                    issues and pull requests to our <a href="https://github.com/RyanEHenderson/Pelagius">GitHub repo</a>
                    so that they can be reviewed and considered for implementation.

                <h2>How do I sign up?</h2>
                <p>
                    We have a simple form below that will ask you a few questions regarding your interest in our project.
                    Submitting this form will help us know who is interested, and give us the ability to send out emails
                    regarding signficant updates to our project (or polls, questionnaires, etc).
